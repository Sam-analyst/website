        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I'm currently a Data Scientist at 84.51, which is a data science
            subsidiary of The Kroger Co. In this role, I get to work with leading 
            technologies to deliver data and insights to some of the biggest consumer
            packaged goods manufacturers in the world. Prior to this role, I 
            worked as an Analyst in varying departments for Kroger Health.
        </p>
        <h2>My Passions & Interests</h2>
        <p>
            As I advance in my data career, I've noticed two key trends:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. My passion for learning new technologies
            <br>
            I get excited learning new technologies and applying them to my work. As
            an Analyst, I had the opportunity to learn SQL and Power BI,
            which I ultimately used to automate our reports. When I transitioned
            to Data Science, I learned Python, Spark, and GitHub, which enabled me 
            to work with very large amounts of data and version control my code.
            Now, I'm beginning to learn technologies like Docker, Airflow, and 
            Github Actions to take my data skills to the next level.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. I find exposing and working on data that others use for decision-making
            rewarding
            <br>
            In my current role, I enjoy developing capabilities that offer new
            perspectives on data. I also have several personal projects, two of which
            focus on extracting data via APIs. You can explore these projects
            on the projects page of my site.
