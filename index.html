        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I'm currently a Data Scientist at 84.51, which is a data science
            subsidiary of The Kroger Co. In this role, I get to work with leading
            technologies to deliver data and insights to some of the biggest consumer
            packaged goods manufacturers in the world. Prior to this role, I
            worked as an Analyst in varying departments for Kroger Health.
        </p>
        <h2>Passions & Interests</h2>
        <p>
            As I continue to grow in my data science career, I've discovered two key passions that drive me:
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>1. A Continuous Curiosity for Emerging Technologies</strong>
            <br>
            I thrive on the challenge of learning and mastering new technologies. In my earlier role as an Analyst, I
            embraced tools like SQL and Power BI, automating reports and optimizing workflows. Transitioning to Data
            Science, I dove into Python, Spark, and GitHub, which empowered me to work with large-scale data and
            implement version control. Now, I'm expanding my toolkit with technologies like Docker, Airflow, and GitHub
            Actions, constantly seeking to push my skills further and enhance my ability to solve complex problems.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>2. The Reward of Enabling Data-Driven Decision-Making</strong>
            <br>
            I find immense satisfaction in creating solutions that offer fresh insights into data and drive impactful
            decisions. In my current role, I focus on developing capabilities that provide new perspectives, helping
            teams make more informed choices. Beyond my professional work, Iâ€™m passionate about personal
            projectsâ€”particularly those that involve extracting and analyzing data through APIs. These projects allow me
            to explore innovative solutions, and you can dive deeper into them on the projects page of my site.
