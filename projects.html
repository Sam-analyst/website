        <p>
            This was my first personal coding project, inspired by my interest in financial
            markets. I wanted to create a script to pull trading data, and below is a sample
            chart of the data I aimed to collect.

            After some reasearch, I discovered Coinbase offers a free API.
            As a Python beginner, I also wanted to dive into object-oriented 
            programming with classes. The result was the following:

        <p>
            While I would design the code differently today, this project
            taught me a lot about working with classes. Although I took a
            break after completing it, if I revisit this project, I'd like
            to add technical indicators and backtesting capabilities to
            analyze profitability.

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/Sam-analyst/nlp_projects" target="_blank" class="modern-link" title="https://github.com/Sam-analyst/nlp_projects">NLP Projects</a></h2>
        <p>
            After the release of ChatGPT and other LLMs, I wanted to explore how
            I could integrate them into my code. For this project, I used a
            pretrained sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face. Once downloaded,
            I could input text and get a positive/negative label along with a score.
            This could be applied to analyze sentiment on social media and reviews
            on a site. Setting it up was surprisingly quick and easy, though
            it could benefit from some fine-tuning. I also built a UI to interact
            with the model using Gradio.

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/Sam-analyst/github_actions" target="_blank" class="modern-link" title="https://github.com/Sam-analyst/github_actions">GitHub Actions</a></h2>
        <p>
            This small repo was my attempt to learn and experiment with GitHub Actions.
            Although I don't come from a software engineering background, I understand
            the importance of testing and QA. After learning about GitHub Actions and
            its role in CI/CD, I decided to dive deeper. I created a simple function
            and unit test to experiment with, after watching these helpful
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hVG9z0fCac&list=PLArH6NjfKsUhvGHrpag7SuPumMzQRhUKY" target="_blank" class="modern-link">YouTube Tutorials</a>.
            After completing this project, I was impressed by how powerful
            GitHub Actions is and how it could greatly benefit teams that manage code.

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/Sam-analyst/twitch_pipeline" target="_blank" class="modern-link" title="https://github.com/Sam-analyst/twitch_pipeline">Twitch Data Pipeline</a></h2>
        <p>    
            This is my latest project, which is still a work in progress. The goal is to create
            an end-to-end data pipeline that extracts data from Twitch's API to track trends over
            time. For context, Twitch is a popular video game streaming platform where people can 
            watch talented gamers play video games in real time. Twitch has a page on their site that shows the 
            most popular games in terms of viewer counts. However, you can only see what the current counts are.
            I thought it would be a neat idea to track viewer trends over time. The goal was to
            develop a series of functions pulling data from Twitch every couple hours, store that 
            in a database, and visualize it. Normally, I would have used Databricks
            for managing my pipeline and Power BI for visualization. Instead, I chose technologies
            I haven't worked with yet.
            <br>
            <br>
            For storage, I ended up choosing Snowflake on AWS since it's a very popular platform. 
            However, I quickly noticed it didn't have the same 
            managed workflow capabilities as Databricks (to my knowledge). This wasn't an issue
            for me though since it gave me the opportunity to work directly with Airflow.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, Airflow also presented its own hurdles for me. My aging MacBook
            couldn't support the necessary dependencies so I turned to AWS EC2 instances.
            Spinning up an EC2 instance was cheap, easy to SSH into with vscode, and most 
            importantly, could run Airflow. Shortly after setting up Airflow to connect to
            Snowflake, I realized Airflow would stop running after logging out of the instance.
            I did some research into Ubuntu's systemd, but ultimately decided that using 
            a managed Airflow service provider was more practical. I then decided to go
            with Astronomer and signed up for their free trial.
            <br>
            <br>
            While I ultimately was able to get my pipeline running in Astronomer
            (<a href="https://github.com/Sam-analyst/twitch_pipeline" target="_blank" class="modern-link">code</a>),
            it took me a few days to learn their platform. I also had to upskill on Docker, a 
            technology I was planning to learn anyway.
            <br>
            <br>
            The last step, which is what I'm currently working on, is visualizing the data.
            I explored Grafana, but found their Snowflake
            plugin requires a paid subscription. While I could pay for the subscription
            or find a free alternative, I'm having thoughts about migrating my data 
            off of Snowflake as it's expensive and the data I'm working with isn't big.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'll update this page as I make more progress.
